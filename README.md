# Professional Page

This program takes user information and automatically populates a resume, a portfolio page and business cards.

## The full project view:
User creates account and starts filling in information about their work experience, education, skills, adding links for deployed projects, github projects, linkedin account and github account.

Then a portfolio page is created as well as a resume. Having the flexibility to add or retract information easily, and being able to change or modify your information. The sizing of the information should be taken into account to fit the resume proportionally.

### Portfolio Page:

### Resume Builder:
The resume builder program is used here to implement the resume section.

### Business Cards:
The business cards are hard coded at the moment. They will populate with simple user information and different styles will be available to choose from.
